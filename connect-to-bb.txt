Steps:
Start a Babashka nREPL server.
Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (if applicable). Execute the following command to start a Babashka nREPL server:

bb nrepl-server

This will typically output the port number the nREPL server is listening on. Note this port number. Connect from Clojure Sublimed.
Open Sublime Text with your Clojure project. Open the Sublime Text Command Palette (usually Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P). Type and select "Clojure Sublimed: Connect to Socket REPL". When prompted for the REPL type, choose "Raw nREPL". Enter the host (usually localhost) and the port number obtained in step 1.
Clojure Sublimed should now be connected to your running Babashka nREPL server, allowing you to interactively evaluate Babashka code within Sublime Text.
